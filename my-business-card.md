# My Business Card

This is my business card for the assignment.  

I don’t like complicated designs; I want it to be simple, timeless, and clean. That’s why, even if the card might seem a bit “plain” 😄, I like it. Since I create different identities and materials for clients, it works with everything, and the main thing for me is to “sell myself” verbally, not with a fancy business card.

It includes the front and back sides of my card.
