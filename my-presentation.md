# My Presentation

For this assignment, I created a presentation about myself. 

It shares information about my interests, the projects I have worked on, and my goals for the future. I included images to help show my work and make the presentation more interesting. 

There is not a lot of text because I like to freestyle and talk freely when I present. This way, I can explain things in my own words and make the presentation feel more natural and personal.
