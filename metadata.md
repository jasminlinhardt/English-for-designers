## Metadata Variations

As part of the assignment, three different metadata variations were created.  
Each variation includes a **title, description, and alt text** for my bespoke character.

### 1. Title: Bespoke character
**Description:**  
How I created the letter "F" from petals.

**Alt Text:**  
The letter "F" and a poem I created about flowers, and that flowers and not just an object but a statement.
