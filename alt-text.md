I started this project by using AI to create the letter F from flower petals. For the poem, I wanted to show that flowers are more than just decoration. They have their own personality. I thought about how flowers move, how they interact with the world, and how they can tell a story. I used images like “petals like whispers” and “blooms that giggle” to make them feel playful and alive.

I also tried to make the poem sound fun and musical by using rhyme and short, lively lines. The last two lines, “he loves me, he loves me not,” connect human feelings to flowers in a playful way. I created this poem by imagining flowers as living, expressive beings and letting my creativity guide me.
